<h3>What is hacking??</h3>
<p>
Hacking is an attempt to exploit a computer system or a private network inside a computer. Simply put, it is the unauthorised access to or control over computer network security systems for some illicit purpose. ... White hat professionals hack to check their own security systems to make it more hack-proof.</p>
	<ul><b>What are common types of cyber attck?</b>
<li>Malware. Malware is a term used to describe malicious software, including spyware, ransomware, viruses, and worms. ...</li>
<li>Phishing. ...</li>
<li>Man-in-the-middle attack. ...</li>
<li>Denial-of-service attack. ...</li>
<li>SQL injection. ...</li>
<li>Zero-day exploit. ...</li>

</ul>

<b>Three Types of Hackers</b>
<p>The three types of hackers are the white hat hacker, the grey hat hacker, and the black hat hacker. Each type of hacker hacks for a different reason, a cause, or both. All have the required skills needed to accomplish their mission. At one end of the spectrum is the black hat, who hacks for evil and malicious intent and without permission. On the other end of the spectrum is the white hat, who hacks against a black hat in order to protect computer and network access and has the company's permission to do so. In the middle is the grey hat, who hacks not for evil and not for good; they are neutral in their cause and usually try to sell their skills for monetary gain, like a mercenary.</p>
<b>Black Hat Hacker - Evil Doer</b>
<p>Closer to the definition that most people outside the IT world know and use, black hat hackers create programs and campaigns solely for causing damage. This may be anything from stealing information using malware to forcefully shutting down networks using denial-of-service attacks.

Kevin Mitnick was the most infamous black hat hacker in the world. During the 1990s, Mitnick went on a two and half year hacking spree where he committed wire fraud and stole millions of dollars of data from telecom companies and the National Defense warning system.</p>
<b>Whtie Hat Hacker - Good Hacker</b>
<p>Sometimes referred to as ethical hackers, or plain old network security specialists, these are the good guys. Whether it’s selling what they find to hardware and software vendors in “bug bounty” programs or working as full-time technicians, white hat hackers are just interested in making an honest buck.

Linus Torvalds is a great example of a white hat hacker. After years of experimenting with the operating system on his computer, he finally released Linux, a secure open-source operating system.</p>
<b>Grey Hat Hacker</b>
<p>Closer to the definition that most people outside the IT world know and use, black hat hackers create programs and campaigns solely for causing damage. This may be anything from stealing information using malware to forcefully shutting down networks using denial-of-service attacks.

“Gray hat” hackers
Whether someone is a security specialist or a cybercriminal, the majority of their work is usually conducted over the internet. This anonymity affords them opportunities to try their hand at both white hat and black hat hacking.

For example, Marcus Hutchins is a known gray hat hacker. He’s most famous for testing the WannaCry ransomware until he found a way to stop it.

During the day, Hutchins works for the Kryptos Logic cybersecurity firm, but the US government believes he spent his free time creating the Kronos banking malware. He has been arrested and branded a “gray hat” hacker.

The world of cybersecurity is far more complicated than the stylized hacking in Hollywood movies. Internet-based warfare is not as simple as good guys vs. bad guys, and it certainly doesn’t give small businesses a pass. If you need a team of experienced professionals to help you tackle the complexities of modern cybersecurity, call us today.</p>
<b>Why Do Hackers Use Linux?</b>
<p>Linux is an extremely popular operating system for hackers. There are two main reasons behind this. First off, Linux's source code is freely available because it is an open source operating system. ... Malicious actors use Linux hacking tools to exploit vulnerabilities in Linux applications, software, and networks.</p>
